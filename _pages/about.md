<!-- ## About me -->
<br>
I am a second year Ph.D. student of the Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences Thrust, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). Before joining HKUST(GZ) in September 2022, I did my master's research in the [School of Oceanography](https://soo.sjtu.edu.cn), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), working with [Prof. Zhaoru Zhang](https://soo.sjtu.edu.cn/szTeachers/3589.html). I did some work in the air-ice-sea interaction processes in the Southern Ocean. I received my bachelor's degree of Petrolumn Engineering in the [School of Petroleum Engineering](https://pe.upc.edu.cn/?ivk_sa=1024320u), [China University of Petroleum](https://www.upc.edu.cn).

Now, I am doing large eddy simulations by using software ***[Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl)*** to better understand the mixing processes in ocean boundary layers under the guidance of [Prof. Qing Li](https://qingli411.github.io/). I am also interested in how to improve existed turbulence closure models based on our understandings of mixing processes by using 1D water column model -- ***[General Ocean Turbulence Model](https://gotm.net/portfolio/)***.
